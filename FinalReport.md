# Introduction

Our project was to code a simple fitness app that would allow a user to time workouts, store relevant YouTube videos, calculate caloric intake, implement a workout journal, and generate custom workout templates. Our motivation was that a multitude of fitness apps that we have used before contain a plethora of unnecessary features. We thought that we would attempt crafting a better, more user-friendly experience. Although our idea was not novel, we hoped to offer a more free and lightweight experience. Collectively, we have a fair amount of experience using Android Studio alongside a high amount of experience with C++ and its relatives. 

Our approach was to first find some base code that would allow us to switch bettween different features. Next, we planned on programming said features. Finally, we would try our hand at graphical design by trying to make the app look as aesthetic and professional as possible. We intended to meet once a week and focus on one thing each to get the project completed.

As far as we got, we could unfortunately only get so much done with each of our time-demanding schedules. Because we started a later than intended, we planned to only implement 4/5 of the original features. We also had to create the most minimal features possible because we lacked the time management to learn the API's necessary to create more elegant/sophisticated features versions.

To summarize, we were not able to create the full product due to time management and underestimating the difficulty of the project. That being said, were able to provide a functional minimal viable product. Overall, we reached 70%-80% of our end goal: the creation of a simple, aesthetic fitness app for beginners and everyone else.
